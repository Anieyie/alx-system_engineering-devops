### What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com in Your 
### Browser and Press Enter
Ever wondered what happens behind the scenes when you type a 
web address into your browser and hit Enter? It’s a fascinating 
process involving many steps and technologies working together 
to bring a web page to your screen.
#### DNS Request
When you type `https://www.google.com`, your browser needs to 
find the IP address associated with the domain. It first checks 
its cache, then your operating system's cache, and if 
necessary, queries your local router and ISP. If the IP address 
is not found, the ISP’s DNS server will perform a broader 
search across other DNS servers until it locates the correct 
address.
#### TCP/IP Connection
With the IP address in hand, your browser establishes a 
connection to the server using the Transmission Control 
Protocol (TCP) over the Internet Protocol (IP). This involves a 
handshake process where your browser and the server exchange 
packets to agree on communication terms.
#### Security Checks: Firewalls and HTTPS/SSL
As data travels, it passes through firewalls that ensure 
malicious traffic doesn’t get through. Since the URL uses 
HTTPS, your connection is secured with SSL/TLS encryption, 
ensuring your data remains private and secure.
#### Load Balancer
For large websites like Google, handling millions of users 
requires multiple servers. Load balancers distribute incoming 
traffic across these servers, ensuring no single server is 
overwhelmed and you get a quick response.
#### Web Server and Application Server
Your request first reaches a web server. If it's for static 
content, the web server handles it. For more complex requests 
like search queries, the web server passes the request to an 
application server, which processes it and interacts with other 
services and databases as needed.
#### Database Interaction
For dynamic content, the application server queries a database. 
The database retrieves the relevant data and sends it back to 
the application server, which prepares the response.
#### Response Delivery
The application server sends the response to the web server, 
which forwards it through the load balancer and firewalls back 
to your browser.
#### Browser Rendering
Your browser receives the response, parses the HTML, applies 
CSS, executes JavaScript, and finally renders the page, 
allowing you to see and interact with it.
### Conclusion
From typing a URL to seeing a web page, numerous components and 
protocols work in harmony, showcasing the complexity and 
efficiency of the web. This journey highlights how data travels 
across the globe in mere milliseconds to bring information to 
your fingertips.
